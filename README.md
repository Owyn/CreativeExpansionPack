## Questions and Answers

**Is there a discord for this mod?**

> There's my Fall Guys **Map Making discord**: https://discord.com/invite/jXBFcwqtn3 

**How is CEP CE different from just CEP?**

> - You can build digital objects (& beta objects) in original maps (and vica versa) with its custom buildable object list - you can also sort it however you want and add\remove items into it
> - Ghost Block support (turned off by default so you don't accidentially make em - turn it on in the `\BepinEx\plugins\CreativeExpansionPack\ExpansionData.txt` config file)
> - Unity Explorer is bundled together with it to **scale** objects and position them precisely (F3 hotkey to toggle its UI)
> - Budget bar feature to count how many objects there are in your map (more than 3k (?) objects could lead to your map failing to load occasionally when playing)
> - Select All & Select All by Type & Select All Scale & Select All in Proximity features
> - You can set max players to 40 even with a single small start-line

**How is Creative Expansion Pack made?**
> Creative Expansion Pack is made using BepinEx, a modding framework for games made with Unity.

**Can I get banned for using Creative Expansion Pack?**
> There's no reported case of a user of the mod getting banned during its private state, but the mod's creator has no implication if Mediatonic takes any actions on your account due to using the mod, use it at your own risk! With the whole nature of Fall Guys Creative and the implications of the mod, the question of if you can use Creative Expansion Pack is up to how much you value your account, even tho you are very unlikely of having to go through a ban if you play it safe...

**Is Creative Expansion Pack against Fall Guys' EULA?**
> After checking, Creative Expansion Pack **seems** to not **explicitly** be against Fall Guys' EULA, this mod doesn't give you a "competitive advantage" over a player playing a legitimate and unmodified copy of the game.â€Ž
>
> However, PLEASE MAKE GOOD USE OF CREATIVE EXPANSION PACK!!! This mod is clearly not a joke and has mad power over Fall Guys Creative, and everyone knows that with great power comes great responsibility.

**I can't play normal Fall Guys when Creative Expansion Pack is installed, how to deal with that?!**
> You can't, in order to play the normal game you got to uninstall BepinEx, you can do that by using the "`TURN_OFF_CEP_CE.bat`" batch script in your game's root and quickly switch back to the mod by using the "`INSTALL_CEP_CE.bat`" batch script that's in the same folder.

## Installation Guide 

 1. Download the latest release of CEP CE https://github.com/Owyn/CreativeExpansionPack/releases 
 
 2. Drop everything within the .zip file in the the zip file into your game's root,
 
 3. Run the `INSTALL_CEP_CE.bat` batch file,
 
 4. Enjoy! Mind that the first boot might take some time...

## Uninstallation (Turning OFF) Guide 

1. Go to your game's root,

2. Run the `TURN_OFF_CEP_CE.bat` batch file, if you want to go back to Expansion Pack just run Install_BepinEx again.
