<p>A Fall Guys mod meant to improve Fall Guys Creative.</p>

<h2 id="questions-and-answers">Questions and Answers</h2>
<p><strong>Is there a discord for this mod?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>There's my Fall Guys <strong>Map Making discord</strong>: <a

</blockquote>
<p><strong>How is CEP CE different from just CEP?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>You can set custom music for your rounds published with CEP CE</li>
<li>You can build digital objects in original maps (and vica versa) with
its custom buildable object list - you can also sort it however you want
and add\remove items into it</li>
<li>Ghost Block support (turned off by default so you don't
accidentially make em - turn it on in the <code>ExpansionData.txt</code>
config file)</li>
<li>Unity Explorer is bundled together with it to <strong>scale</strong>
objects and position them precisely (F3 hotkey to toggle its UI)</li>
<li>Budget bar feature to count how many objects there are in your map
(more than 3k (?) objects could lead to your map failing to load
occasionally when playing)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How is Creative Expansion Pack made?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Creative Expansion Pack is made using BepinEx, a modding framework
for games made with Unity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Can I get banned for using Creative Expansion
Pack?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>There's no reported case of a user of the mod getting banned during
its private state, but the mod's creator has no implication if
Mediatonic takes any actions on your account due to using the mod, use
it at your own risk! With the whole nature of Fall Guys Creative and the
implications of the mod, the question of if you can use Creative
Expansion Pack is up to how much you value your account, even tho you
are very unlikely of having to go through a ban if you play it
safe...</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Is Creative Expansion Pack against Fall Guys'
EULA?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>After checking, Creative Expansion Pack <strong>seems</strong> to not
<strong>explicitly</strong> be against Fall Guys' EULA, this mod doesn't
give you a "competitive advantage" over a player playing a legitimate
and unmodified copy of the game.â€Ž</p>
<p>However, PLEASE MAKE GOOD USE OF CREATIVE EXPANSION PACK!!! This mod
is clearly not a joke and has mad power over Fall Guys Creative, and
everyone knows that with great power comes great responsibility.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>I can't play normal Fall Guys when Creative Expansion Pack is
installed, how to deal with that?!</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can't, in order to play the normal game you got to uninstall
BepinEx, you can do that by using the "Restore_EAC" batch script in your
game's root and quickly switch back to the mod by using the
"Install_BepinEx" batch script that's in the same folder.</p>
